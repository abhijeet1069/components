# Team practices

## Overtime

Working overtime is not a way to show your dedication to your employer. What it shows is that you are a bad planner,
that you agree to deadlines to which you shouldn’t agree, that you make promises you shouldn’t make, that
you are a manipulable laborer and not a professional.
    This is not to say that all overtime is bad, nor that you should never work overtime. There are extenuating
    circumstances for which the only option is to work overtime. But they should be extremely rare. And you must be very
    aware that the cost of that overtime will likely be greater than the time you save on the schedule.

## Sleep

The most precious ingredient in the life of a programmer is sufficient sleep. I do well on seven hours.

## Collective Ownership

Collective Ownership does not mean that you cannot specialize. As systems grow in complexity, specialization becomes an
absolute necessity. There are systems that simply cannot be understood in both entirety and detail.
    However, even as you specialize, you must also generalize. Divide your work between your specialty and other areas
    of the code. Maintain your ability to work outside of your specialty.

I have seen a few companies that practiced the opposite of Collective Ownership. Each programmer owned their own
modules, and no one else was allowed to touch them. These were grossly dysfunctional teams who were constantly involved
in finger pointing and miscommunication.
    All progress in a module would stop when the author was not at work. No one else dared to work on something owned by
someone else.

## Standup Meetings

• This meeting is optional. Many teams get by just fine without one.
• It can be less often than daily. Pick the schedule that makes sense to you.
• It should take ~10 minutes, even for large teams.
• This meeting follows a simple formula.

The basic idea is that the team members stand9 in a circle and answer three questions:

1. What did I do since the last meeting?
2. What will I do until the next meeting?
3. What is in my way?

### Chicken and the Pig

A Pig and a Chicken are walking down the road.
The Chicken says: "Hey Pig, I was thinking we should open a restaurant!"
Pig replies: "Hm, maybe, what would we call it?"
The Chicken responds: "How about 'ham-n-eggs'?"
The Pig thinks for a moment and says: "No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved."

The gist is that only developers should speak at the standup. Managers and other folks may listen in but should not
interject.
