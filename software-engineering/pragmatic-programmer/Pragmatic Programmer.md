# Pragmatic Programmer

## Care about Your Craft

## Think! about your work

We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.

## You have agency

If technology seems to be passing you by, make time (in your own time) to study new stuff that looks interesting. 
You’re investing in yourself, so doing it while you’re off-the-clock is only reasonable.

Want to work remotely? Have you asked? If they say no, then find someone who says yes.
This industry gives you a remarkable set of opportunities. Be proactive, and take them.

## Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses

Programmers take charge of their own career, and aren’t afraid to admit ignorance or error. It’s not the most 
pleasant aspect of programming, to be sure, but it will happen—even on the best of projects. Despite thorough testing, 
good documentation, and solid automation, things go wrong. Deliveries are late. Unforeseen technical problems come up.
    These things happen, and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. This means being honest and direct.
We can be proud of our abilities, but we must own up to our shortcomings—our ignorance and our mistakes.

When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make a
mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.

## Don’t Live with Broken Windows

Don’t leave “broken windows” (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is
discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Perhaps you can comment out the
offending code, or display a "Not Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take some action to prevent
further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation.

## Be a Catalyst for Change

## Remember the Big Picture

## Make Quality a Requirements Issue

## Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio

An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. - Benjamin Franklin

Invest regularly. Just as in financial investing, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly. Even if it’s
just a small amount, the habit itself is as important as the sums.

## Orthogonality

Build orthogonal systems. In vector terms, orthogonal lines(perpendicular lines) are independent of each other. Move
along one of the lines, and your position projected onto the other doesen't change.

## Isolation can be deadly to your career

## Communicate

Unless you work in a vacuum, you need to be able to communicate. The more effective that communication, the more influential you become.
Always respond to emails and voicemails, even if the response is simply “I’ll get back to you later.’’ Keeping people informed makes them far more 
forgiving of the occasional slip, and makes them feel that you haven’t forgotten them.
