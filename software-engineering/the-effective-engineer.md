# The Effective Engineer

## Leverage

To be effective engineers, we need to be able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller
time investments. Not all work is created equal. Not all efforts, however well intentioned translate into
impact.

An effective engineer, is defined by the rate at which he or she produces value per unit time worked.

Leverage = Impact_produced / Time_invested

To increase leverage ask yourself:

a) How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?
b) How can I increase the value produced by this activity?
c) Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?

## Optimize for learning

You need to take control and take ownership of your own learning and growth, rather than waiting for opportunities to come to you.
Learning compounds over time.

## Measuring Output

Output is measured in a variety of ways:

a) Attending meetings
b) Reviewing changes
c) Responding to emails
d) Monitoring metrics
e) Investigating bugs
f) Maintaining production system
g) Refactoring old code
h) Interviewing potential hires
i) Developing new features

## Growth Mindset

Keep a growth mindset.

Own your story - It means accepting responsibility for each aspect of a situation that you can change—anything from improving your conversational skills to mastering a new engineering focus—rather than blaming failures and
shortcomings on things outside your control. It means taking control of your own story. It means optimizing for experiences where you learn rather than for experiences where you effortlessly succeed. And it means investing in your rate of learning.

Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Knowledge gives you a foundation, enabling you to gain more knowledge even faster. For example, an understanding of recursion provides the basis for many other concepts, like trees and graph searches, which in turn are necessary for understanding compilers and network topologies.
When we spend our work hours on unchallenging tasks, we’re not just boring ourselves and missing out on chances to learn—we’re also paying a huge opportunity cost in terms of our future growth and learning.

## Factors for new job or team

While choosing a new job or team. The factors needed to be kept in mind are:

1) Fast growth:

If you are offerred a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat? A lack of growth on the other hand leads to stagnation
and politics.
Questions to consider:

a) What is the weekly or monthly growth rates of core business metrics (e.g. active users, annual recurring revenue,
   products sold, etc.)?
b) Are the particular initiatives that you'd be working on high prorities, with sufficient support and resources
   from the company to grow?
c) How aggressively has the company or team been hiring in the past year?
d) How quickly have the strongest team members grown into positions of leadership?

2) Training:
Questions to consider:

a) Is each new person expected to figure out on his or her own, or is there a more formalized way of onboarding new engineers?
b) Is there formal or informal mentorship?
c) What steps has the company taken to ensure that team members continue to learn and grow?
d) What new things have team members learned recently?

3) Culture of openness
Questions to consider:

a) Do employees know what priorities different teams are working on?
b) Do teams meet to reflect on whether product changes and feature launches were worth the effort? Do they conduct post-mortems after outages?
c) How is knowledge documented and shared across the company?
d) What are examples of lessons that the team has learned?

4) Pace
Questions to consider:

a) What is the weekly or monthly growth rates of core business metrics(e.g. active users, annual recurring revenue, products sold etc.)
b) Are the particular initiatives that you'd be working on high priorities, with sufficient support and resources from the company to grow?
c) How aggressively has the company or team been hiring in the past year?
d) How quickly have the strongest team members grown into positions of leadership?

5) People - Surround yourself with people who are smarter, more talented and more creative than you.
Questions to consider:

a) Do the people who interviewed you seem smarter than you?
b) Are there skills they can teach you?
c) Were your interviews rigorous and comprehensive? Would you want to work with the types of people who would do well on them?
d) Do people tend to work on one-person projects, or are teamwork and cooperation common themes?

6) Autonomy - Freedom to choose

a) Do people have autonomy to choose what projects they work on and how they do them?
b) How often do individuals switch teams or projects?
c) What breadth of the codebase can an individual expect to work on over the course of a year?
d) Do engineers participate in discussions on product design and influence product direction?

## Things to do while at work

1) Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers of your company.
2) Write more code.
3) Go through any technical, educational material available internally.
4) Master the programming languages you use, and one scripting language.
5) Send your code reviews to the harshest critics.
6) Enroll in classes in areas you want to improve.
7) Participate in the design discussion of the project you are involved in.
8) Make sure you are in a team with a few senior engineers, whom you can learn from.
9) Jump fearlessly into code you don't know.

To invest in your own growth, you should carve out your own 20% time.
You can develop a deeper understanding of areas you’re already working on and tools that you already use.

Research in positive psychology shows that continual learning is inextricably linked with increased happiness.

Prioritize Regularly

If you have to do something manually more than twice, then write a tool for the third time..

## Measure what you improve

Measuring progress and performance is actually a powerful tool for assessing your own effectiveness and prioritizing  your work.

If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.
Define a metric associated with your goal. For ex:
Weekly active rate, Response time, Click through rate etc.

Instrument everything to understand what's going on.

For ex:To optimize web-app response time you need to decompose the metric in the DB layer, caching layer, server side rendering logic,
Data transfer over network and client side rendering code.

Access Type:Latency
L1 cache reference:0.5 ns
Branch mispredict:5 ns
L2 cache reference:7 ns
Mutex lock/unlock:100 ns
Main memory reference:100 ns
Compress 1K bytes with Snappy:10,000 ns = 10 µs
Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network:20 µs
Read 1 MB sequentially from memory:250 µs
Round trip within same data-center:500 µs
Disk seek:10 ms
Read 1 MB sequentially from network:10 ms
Read 1 MB sequentially from disk:30 ms
Send packet CA-> Netherlands -> CA:150 ms

When it comes to metrics, compare the numbers with your intuition to see if they align. Try to arrive at the same data from a different direction and see if the metrics still make sense.

Make sure your data is reliable. The only thing worse than having no data is the illusion of having the right data. Having bad data is worse than having no data.

Don't try to get everything done. Focus on what matters and what matters is what produces value. Working on one thing also means not working with other.

## Master the fundamentals of your crafts

a) Get proficient with your favourite text editor or IDE.
b) Learn atleast one productive, high level programming language and one scripting language
c) Get familiar with UNIX or Windows shell commands.
d) Prefer keyboard over mouse
e) Automate your manual workflows. Once you have manually performed a task 3 or more times. Think to automate it. Shell scripts or browser extensions etc.
f) Test out ideas on an interactive interpreter.
g) Make it fast and easy to run just the unit tests associated with your current changes.

Given how much time we spend with our programming environments, mastering the basic tools that we use multiple times per day is a high leverage investment. It shifts our limited time from the mechanics of programming to more important problems.

## Focus on the important and non-urgent

				Urgent					Non-Urgent
Important		Crises					Planning and Prevention
				Pressing Issues			Building relationships
				Deadlines				New opportunities
										Personal development

Not-Important	Interruptions			Surfing the web
				Most meetings			Busy work
				Most emails and calls	Time wasters		

Quadrant 2 investments don't have any natural deadlines and won't get prioritized as a result of urgency. But in the long run, they provide significant value because they help us to learn and grow both personally and professionally.

Quadrant 2 activities include:

a) Planning our carrer goals.
b) Building stronger relationships.
c) Reading books and articles for professional development.
d) Adopting new productivity and efficiency habits.
e) Building tools to improve our workflows.
f) Investing in useful abstractions.
g) Ensuring that infrastructure will continue to scale.
h) Learning new programming languages.
i) Speaking at conferences.
j) Mentoring our team mates to help them to be more productive.

Quadrant 1, Quadrant 4 -> Crisis life
Quadrant 3, Quadrant 4 -> Irresponsible life
Effective people stay out of Quadrant 3,4. They also shrink Quadrant 1 down to size by spending more time in Quadrant 2.

The only place to get time for Quadrant 2 in the beginning is from Quadrant 3,4. You can't ignore the urgent and important
activities of Quadrant 1, although it will shrink in size as you spend more time with prevention and preparation in Quadrant 2.
But the initial time for Quadrant 2 has to come from Quadrant 3,4.
You have to be proactive to work on Quadrant 2 because  Quadrant 1,3 will work on you. To say yes to important Quadrant 2
priorities, you have to learn to say no to other activities, sometimes apparently urgent things.
