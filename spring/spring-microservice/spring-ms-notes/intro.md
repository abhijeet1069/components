# Microservice patterns

## Core development patterns

Spring Boot, Spring cloud config, Spring cloud stream

-  Service granularity : Ensuring each microservice has the right level of responsibility. (Spring Boot)

-  Communication protocols : JSON (Spring Boot)

-  Interface design : How to structure service URLs to communicate intent?

-  Configuration Management of service : How to move between different environments in cloud so as to never change app 
                                        code or config? (Spring Cloud Config)

-  Event processing between services : (Spring Cloud Stream, integrates with RabbitMQ)
    
## Routing patterns

How do I get my client's request for a service to a specific instance of a service?

-  Service Discovery : How do you make your microservice discoverable so client applications can find them without 
        having the location of the service hardcoded into the application. (Netflix Eureka)

-  Service routing : How do you provide a single entry point of all your services so that security policies and routing 
                     rules are applied uniformly to multiple services and service instances in your microservice 
                     solution. (Netflix Zuul)
    
## Client resiliency patterns

Preventing problems of a single service from cascading up and out to the consumers of the service.

- Client side load balancing :  How do you cache the location of your service instances on the service client so that 
    calls to multiple instances of a microservice are load balanced to all the health instances of that microservice? 
    (Netflix Ribbon)

- Circuit breaker pattern : How do you prevent a client from continuing to call a service that is failing or suffering 
        performance problems? (Netflix Hystrix)

- Fallback pattern : When a service call fails, how do you provide a “plug-in” mechanism that will allow the service 
    client to try to carry out its work through alternative means other than the microservice being called? 
    (Netflix Hystrix)

- Bulkhead pattern : Microservice applications use multiple distributed resources to carry out their work. How do you 
    compartmentalize these calls so that the misbehavior of one service call doesn’t negatively impact the rest of the 
    application? (Netflix Hystrix)
  
## Security patterns

- Authentication : How do you determine the service client calling the service is who they say they are? 
    (Security/OAuth2)

- Authorization : How do you determine whether the service client calling a microservice is allowed to undertake the 
    action they’re trying to undertake? (Security/OAuth2)
    
- Credential management and propagation : How do you prevent a service client from constantly having to present their 
    credentials for service calls involved in a transaction? (Security/OAuth2/JWT)

## Logging and tracing patterns : 

- Log correlation : How do you tie together all the logs produced between services for a single user transaction? With 
    this pattern, we’ll look at how to implement a correlation ID, which is a unique identifier that will be carried 
    across all service calls in a transaction and can be used to tie together log entries produced from each service. 
    (Spring cloud Sleuth)

- Log aggregation : With this pattern we’ll look at how to pull together all of the logs produced by your microservices 
    (and their individual instances) into a single queryable database. We’ll also look at how to use correlation IDs to 
    assist in searching your aggregated logs. (Spring cloud Sleuth with Papertrail)

- Microservice tracing : Finally, we’ll explore how to visualize the flow of a client transaction across all the 
    services involved and understand the performance characteristics of services involved in the transaction. 
    (Spring cloud Sleuth/Zipkin)

## Build and deployment patterns

One of the core parts of a microservice architecture is that each instance of a microservice should be identical to all 
    its other instances. You can’t allow “configuration drift” (something changes on a server after it’s been deployed) 
    to occur, because this can introduce instability in your applications.

- Build and deployment pipeline : How do you create a repeatable build and deployment process that emphasizes one button
    builds and deployment to any environment in your organization? (Travis CI)

- Infrastructure as code : How do you treat the provisioning of your services as code that can be executed and managed 
    under source control? (Docker)

- Immutable Infrastructure : Once a microservice image is created, how do you ensure that it’s never changed after it 
    has been deployed? (Docker)

- Phoenix Servers : The longer a server is running, the more opportunity for configuration drift. How do you ensure that
    servers that run microservices get torn down on a regular basis and recreated off an immutable image? 
    (Travis CI/Docker)
